# Space tourism multi-page website
This is a challenge in frontendmentor.io(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3/hub)
 I built this project with React.js and React-Router and also wanted to practice on my sass skills so I styled it using sass.

## Overview
It was an intermediate project. 
I learnt a lot about lists and how navigation works through React-Router. I tried to work on my organizational skills and naming of the components and of the styling.
It took me sometime to familiarize my self and upskill my understanding on containers and how to best use them for responsive website building.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
